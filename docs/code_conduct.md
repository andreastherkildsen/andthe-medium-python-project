## 1. General Guidelines

### 1.1. Do's

- **Do follow the DRY principle:** Don't Repeat Yourself. Avoid duplicating code. If you find yourself writing the same code in multiple places, consider refactoring it into a reusable component.

- **Do write self-documenting code:** Your code should be clear and easy to understand without the need for excessive comments. Use meaningful variable and method names.

- **Do follow the SOLID principles:** Strive for Single Responsibility, Open/Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, and Dependency Inversion principles in your code.

- **Do use version control:** Commit your code frequently, provide meaningful commit messages, and follow branching strategies if applicable (e.g., Git flow).

- **Do write unit tests:** Ensure good test coverage for your code to catch and prevent issues early.

### 1.2. Don'ts

- **Don't hardcode sensitive information:** Avoid hardcoding credentials, API keys, and other sensitive data directly into your code. Use configuration files or environment variables.

- **Don't leave commented-out code:** Remove or refactor commented-out code. It clutters the codebase and makes it harder to maintain.

- **Don't ignore code reviews:** Participate in code reviews actively. Constructive feedback and discussion are essential for maintaining code quality.

- **Don't bypass security practices:** Always validate user input, use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection, and implement proper authentication and authorization mechanisms.

## Conclusion

By adhering to these guidelines and best practices, we can ensure a consistent and high-quality project. Remember that teamwork, communication, and continuous improvement are key to our success. If you have questions or need clarification on any of these points, don't hesitate to ask. Together, we can build a robust and maintainable application.
